# GOT-10k MATLAB Toolkit

This repository contains the official matlab toolkit for running experiments and evaluate performance on [GOT-10k](https://got-10k.github.io) benchmark. For convenience, it also provides unofficial implementation of tracking pipelines for [OTB](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/index.html) and [VOT](http://votchallenge.net) benchmarks. The code is written in pure matlab and is compile-free.

[GOT-10k](https://got-10k.github.io) is a large, high-diversity and one-shot database for evaluating generic purposed visual trackers. If you use the GOT-10k database or toolkits for a research publication, please consider citing:
